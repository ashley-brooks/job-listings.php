# job-listings.php
A Job Listings PHP Class that uses external DB data

This class uses an external DB to pull job listing data into a Wordpress build, using the wpdb() class.

These job listings are then displayed in a list format.

I've also created a custom pagination method, and search functionality to go alongside these listings.
